# Bros Mod Installer
## Description
A little utility program used to sync up a Google Drive public folder with the .minecraft/mods folder.
It also installs Forge if needed.

## Note
This program is badly written.
An update is planned to allow for mod config management and to add other configs for project and modpack.
